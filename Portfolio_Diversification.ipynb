    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use the InvestOps functions `diversify_weights` and `diversify_weights_sparse` for improving the diversification of an investment portfolio, by lowering the correlations between different assets in the portfolio. The method is dubbed \"Hvass Diversification\" and is described in Section 8 of the [long paper](#refs) referenced below, and a more concise description is given in the [short paper](#refs). The method is simple, extremely fast to compute, and very robust to estimation errors in the correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly explained, given some portfolio weights of how much we want to invest in each asset, the diversification method calculates the so-called \"Full Exposure\" of how much the portfolio is actually exposed to each asset, both through the direct investment in each asset, but also through the correlation with other assets in the portfolio. The diversification method then uses a fairly simple and extremely fast algorithm to find new portfolio weights, whose Full Exposure is equal to the originally desired portfolio weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the diversification method is only allowed to decrease the portfolio weights, the worst that can happen is that it moves too much of the portfolio into cash, which makes it extremely robust to estimation errors in the correlation matrix."

This of course depends on the exact values of the portfolio weights and correlations. It would be an interesting topic for you to research further. Perhaps it could lead to deeper insights into why the diversification algorithm works so well."
